# Tootti for iOS

## Built for musicians to collaborate from anywhere

There are two directories, app/ and server/.
app/ directory stores the obj-c code for iOS code
server/ might be required in the future if we choose to design our own server. If we use exisiting chat functionality from AWS FaaS, this directory is not required. 


Storyboard file commits should be tracked to prevent conflict issues
